When a quarterback drops back in the pocket on a passing play, what is the role of the offensive lineman? Generally, it is to keep the pass rusher as far from the quarterback as possible. Doing so, he gives the quarterback enough time, physical space, and peace of mind to complete a pass to an eligible receiver.

Below we see a series of combinations between distances of various numbers of pass rushers from a quarterback on the final frame he is deemed to have possession of the football, along with the associated Expected Points Added (EPA) of the play. We see that as the distance decreases and and the number of rushers within that distance increases, offensive performance declines.
